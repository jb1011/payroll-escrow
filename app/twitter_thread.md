🧵 **Thread:**

1/6
Just built a payroll app to test things out with the new arc testnet.

The UI has two tabs: "Employer" and "Employee"

Employer: "I control the money 💰"
Employee: "Where's my money? 💸"

It's like a Choose Your Own Adventure book but with more anxiety and blockchain.

The "Connect Wallet" button is so prominent it's basically yelling at you.

_"HEY! CONNECT YOUR WALLET! I DARE YOU!"_

It's like that friend who won't stop asking you to join their crypto project. Except this time, you actually need to.

There's a "Stream Counter" that shows how many payment streams exist.

It's like a scoreboard but for... payroll? I'm not sure if this is genius or if I've been coding too long. Probably both.

The color scheme is dark purple and cyan. It's giving "I work in tech" vibes mixed with "I might be a supervillain."

At least I'm honest about it.

Bottom line: It's functional, it's pretty, and it makes payroll feel like a video game.

If your employees complain about the UI, they're probably just salty about the vesting schedule anyway. Can't please everyone. 🤷‍♂️
