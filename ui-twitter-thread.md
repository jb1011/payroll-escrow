# PayrollEscrow UI Twitter Thread 🧵

**Tweet 1 - The Philosophy:**
💻 Just shipped a UI for our payroll escrow. No overthinking. No 20-step onboarding. Just connect wallet → create stream → done.

We simply make stuff. That's it. 🚀

---

**Tweet 2 - What You See:**
🎨 Dark theme inspired by ARCScan. Clean cards. Two tabs: Employer & Employee.

No clutter. No confusion. Just the actions you need.

Connect → Fill form → Click button. That's the whole flow.

---

**Tweet 3 - The Simplicity:**
✨ Complex DeFi interaction? Nah.

We made it:

- 3 fields to create a stream
- 1 button to withdraw
- Automatic approvals built-in
- No manual contract calls

If it's not simple, it's not done.

---

**Tweet 4 - Built With:**
⚛️ React + TypeScript + Ethers.js

That's it. No fancy frameworks. No over-engineering.

Just Vite, a few hooks, and some CSS. Ship fast, iterate faster.

---

**Tweet 5 - The Result:**
🎯 From idea to working UI in hours.

No waiting for "perfect". No committee approvals. Just build → ship → improve.

That's how we make stuff. Simple. Fast. Real.
